Revision history for Module-Depends-Tree

0.01    Sat Aug 19 23:48:49 CDT 2006

This is a tool for digging into dependencies and showing a snazzy
little tree.  I needed it to figure out all the dependencies in
Socialtext Open (http://sourceforge.net/programs/socialtext/).

It's very rough, and not very generalized.  Patches and input
welcome.
